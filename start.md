## Get network access
To start experimenting on and learning more about the Stellar network, use an exchange to buy lumens. This is not investment advice.

![Store lumens](./assets/store-lumens-safely.jpeg)

## Store lumens
You keep your savings in harder-to-use, more secure accounts, and you keep your spending cash in a less secure, easier-to-access location. Use a similar approach to stay secure on Stellar.

## Explore the ledger
Use a ledger explorer to look up accounts and transactions and explore the network. StellarExpert is a mobile-friendly ledger explorer and analysis platform with detailed asset stats, retrospective analysis, and charts.

![Trade on the Stellar DEX](./assets/trade-on-the-stellar-DEX.jpeg)

## Trade on the Stellar DEX
Use the Stellar decentralized exchange (DEX) to trade peer-to-peer - from currencies like bitcoin to Euros to Chinese Yuan to one of the thousand tokens on the network - all for free and with fiat on ramps. You can use one of many user interfaces to access the DEX - StellarX, Stellarport, StellarTerm, and more.
